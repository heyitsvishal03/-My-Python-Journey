# -My-Python-Journey
This repository marks the beginning of my Python programming journey. I'm exploring the basics of Python including variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, and more. My goal is to build a strong foundation and gradually move toward real-world projects and advanced concepts like data science and machine learning.
